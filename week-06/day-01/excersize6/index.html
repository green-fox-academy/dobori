            <p>I would like a trial by combat. What is dead may never die. The War of the 5 kings. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. Winter is coming. You know nothing, Jon Snow. The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. The rains of castamere. You know nothing, Jon Snow. The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall. And now his watch is ended. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. The Knight of Lemonwood. The rains of castamere. The Knight of Lemonwood. The wolf and the lion. Can a man still be brave if he’s afraid? That is the only time a man can be brave. More pigeon pie, please. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. House Tarly of Horn Hill</p>
